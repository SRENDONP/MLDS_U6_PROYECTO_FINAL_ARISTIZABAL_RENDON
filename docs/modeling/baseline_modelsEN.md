# Baseline Model Report for X-Ray Image Classification

This document details the analysis and conclusions of the baseline model used for classifying X-ray images into three categories: Bacteria, Normal, and Virus.

## Model Description

The implemented baseline model is a simplified convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by the VGG16 architecture. This model serves as an initial benchmark to evaluate performance and effectiveness in medical image classification.

## Input Variables

- X-ray images (RGB).
- Image size: 150x150 pixels.

## Target Variable

- Categorical classification into three groups: Bacteria, Normal, Virus.

## Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy.
- Recall.
- F1-Score.
- Confusion Matrix.

### Evaluation Results

| Class    | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bacteria | 0.76      | 0.69   | 0.72     |
| Normal   | 0.86      | 0.91   | 0.88     |
| Virus    | 0.67      | 0.69   | 0.68     |
| **Total**| **0.76**  | **0.76**| **0.76** |

- **Loss**: 0.8611
- **Accuracy**: 76.33%

## Analysis of Results

The model shows an overall satisfactory accuracy of 76.33%. However, upon detailed analysis:

- **Strengths**: The model is particularly effective in the 'Normal' category, with high scores across all metrics. This indicates a good ability to identify normal cases, which is crucial in clinical practice to avoid false positives.

- **Weaknesses**: The 'Virus' category presents the lowest values in precision and F1-Score. This suggests difficulties in differentiating between normal and pathological images with viral characteristics, which could lead to a significant number of false negatives or false positives in this category.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

1. **Potential for Improvement**: Despite its overall efficacy, the model could benefit from a more complex architecture or advanced image processing techniques to improve precision, especially in the 'Virus' category.

2. **Exploring Architectures**: Experimenting with variants of deeper CNN architectures, such as VGG19 or ResNet, could offer significant improvements.

3. **Integration of Medical Expertise**: Incorporating inputs from medical experts in the preprocessing phase and hyperparameter tuning may be key to fine-tuning the model's ability to distinguish subtle pathologies.

4. **Continuous Evaluation**: Given the importance of accuracy in medical applications, continuous evaluations and adjustments of the model with new data and emerging techniques are crucial.
